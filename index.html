                <p>The project I made for my CMSC 12 class, a couple of years ago was that of a connect 4 and connect 5 game using the terminal. Though it's not really complicated, this project meant a lot because it's my first.</p>

                <h2>Autobiography</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">I was born in July 10, 2001 as the first child of my Mom and Dad and I would turn out to be the last as well. I grew up in a stereotypical middle class family <br>where a holiday in Boracay or Hong Kong for a family of three was all that we could afford though it's certainly enough. 
                    I spent most of my <br>schooldays in the Ateneo de Manila University where I studied for the better part of 12 years. College was a big decision for me because I decided to be <br>reconsidered into UP Cebu after having reserved a slot in Ateneo.
                    This was my first time away from my family and alone for an extended period of time let <br>alone be in a pandemic, trapped alone for the first time. Alas, I find myself in UPLB studying Computer Science and having a great time.
